      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Marcos Saade — a Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Mathematician with a passion for machine learning, AI, and building useful, human-centered technology. I enjoy working on projects that blend technical depth with real-world impact, from early diagnosis tools for neurological conditions to game-playing agents and finance models.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve also worked on freelance and research-based software projects, focusing on full-stack development, intelligent systems, and applications that combine data science with hardware integration. My experience includes handling diverse data types such as tabular data, audio, and images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of class and research, I’m also deeply interested in physics, game development, and cybersecurity.
